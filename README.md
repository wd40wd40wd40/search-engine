# search-engine

Important concepts:
1. Crawler (How it functions)
2. Lemmatization
3. Reverse Indexing
4. Concurrency/Parrallelism
5. Robots.txt
6. TF-IDF
7. Storage
8. Normalizing links (Links don't lead to same location)



FUTURE Improvements:
    Crawler:
        1. Add a database to store previously crawled data with a time of crawl attached. Can then set condition to recrawl
            after set amount of time or manual update.
