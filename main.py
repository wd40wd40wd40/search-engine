# main.py

# Step 1: Import necessary modules
# Import NLTK setup
# Import Crawler, Indexer, Ranker

async def main():
    # Step 2: Set up NLTK resources
    # Run setup_nltk()

    # Step 3: Define seed URLs
    # Initialize crawler with seed URLs

    # Step 4: Initialize indexer and ranker
    # Create Indexer and Ranker instances

    # Step 5: Crawl and index content
    # For each URL fetched by the crawler:
    #   - Send the content to the indexer for processing

    # Step 6: Finalize index
    # Call finalize() on the indexer to compute TF-IDF

    # Step 7: Perform search queries
    # Use the ranker to search for a query and display results
